This is a merge of two projects https://github.com/DavidKHahn/Learn-TDD-Cypress-React and https://github.com/taniarascia/react-hooks with adding Jest React testing library tests with 100% coverage for unit tests (except index.js that is trivial)
* Planning to add some custom hooks and tier tests like in https://github.com/jamesfulford/testing-react-hooks
* Plannig to add express and mock server testing for remote calls mocking
